    /// Blocks are created to prevent certain customer details from being used
    /// when creating
    /// mandates.
    /// 
    /// The details used to create blocks can be exact matches, like a bank
    /// account or an email,
    /// or a more generic match such as an email domain or bank name. Please be
    /// careful when creating
    /// blocks for more generic matches as this may block legitimate payers from
    /// using your service.
    /// 
    /// New block types may be added over time.
    /// 
    /// A block is in essence a simple rule that is used to match against
    /// details in a newly
    /// created mandate. If there is a successful match then the mandate is
    /// transitioned to a
    /// "blocked" state.
    /// 
    /// Please note:
    /// 
    ///   - Payments and subscriptions cannot be created against a mandate in
    /// blocked state.
    ///   - A mandate can never be transitioned out of the blocked state.
    /// 
    /// The one exception to this is when blocking a 'bank_name'. This block
    /// will prevent bank
    /// accounts from being created for banks that match the given name. To
    /// ensure we match
    /// bank names correctly an existing bank account must be used when creating
    /// this block. Please
    /// be aware that we cannot always match a bank account to a given bank
    /// name.
