    /// 
    /// - The first payment must be charged within 1 year.
    /// - If `day_of_month` and `start_date` are not provided `start_date` will
    /// be the [mandate](#core-endpoints-mandates)'s `next_possible_charge_date`
    /// and the subscription will then recur based on the `interval` &
    /// `interval_unit`
    /// - If `month` or `day_of_month` are present the following validations
    /// apply:
    /// 
    /// | __interval_unit__ | __month__                                      |
    /// __day_of_month__                           |

    /// 
    /// - if the recurrence rule specified `-1` as the `day_of_month`, the

    /// (i.e., the last working day of the month).
    /// - otherwise the charge date will be rolled __forwards__ to the next
    /// business day.
