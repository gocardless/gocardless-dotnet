    /// Mandate Imports allow you to migrate existing mandates from other
    /// providers into the
    /// GoCardless platform.
    /// 
    /// The process is as follows:
    /// 
    ///   1. [Create a mandate
    /// import](#mandate-imports-create-a-new-mandate-import)
    ///   2. [Add entries](#mandate-import-entries-add-a-mandate-import-entry)
    /// to the import
    ///   3. [Submit](#mandate-imports-submit-a-mandate-import) the import
    ///   4. Wait until a member of the GoCardless team approves the import, at
    /// which point the mandates will be created
    ///   5. [Link up the
    /// mandates](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries) in
    /// your system
    /// 
    /// When you add entries to your mandate import, they are not turned into
    /// actual mandates
    /// until the mandate import is submitted by you via the API, and then
    /// processed by a member
    /// of the GoCardless team. When that happens, a mandate will be created for
    /// each entry in the import.
    /// 
    /// We will issue a `mandate_created` webhook for each entry, which will be
    /// the same as the webhooks
    /// triggered when [ creating a mandate ](#mandates-create-a-mandate) using
    /// the mandates API. Once these
    /// webhooks start arriving, any reconciliation can now be accomplished by
    /// [checking the current status](#mandate-imports-get-a-mandate-import) of
    /// the mandate import and
    /// [linking up the mandates to your
    /// system](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries).
    /// 
    /// <p class="notice">Note that all Mandate Imports have an upper limit of
