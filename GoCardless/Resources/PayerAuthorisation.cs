    /// 
    /// The process to use the Payer Authorisation API is as follows:
    /// 
    ///   1. Create a Payer Authorisation, either empty or with already
    /// available information
    ///   2. Update the authorisation with additional information or fix any
    /// mistakes
    ///   3. Submit the authorisation, after the payer has reviewed their
    /// information
    ///   4. [coming soon] Redirect the payer to the verification mechanisms
    /// from the response of the Submit request (this will be introduced as a
    /// non-breaking change)
    ///   5. Confirm the authorisation to indicate that the resources can be
    /// created
    /// 
    /// After the Payer Authorisation is confirmed, resources will eventually be
    /// created as it's an asynchronous process.
    /// 
    /// To retrieve the status and ID of the linked resources you can do one of
    /// the following:
    /// <ol>
    ///   <li> Listen to <code>  payer_authorisation_completed </code>  <a
