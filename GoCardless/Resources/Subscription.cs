    ///
    /// The following rules apply when specifying recurrence:
    ///
    /// - The first payment must be charged within 1 year.
    /// - When neither `month` nor `day_of_month` are present, the subscription
    /// will recur from the `start_date` based on the `interval_unit`.
    /// - If `month` or `day_of_month` are present, the recurrence rules will be
    /// applied from the `start_date`, and the following validations apply:
    ///
    /// | interval_unit   | month                                          |
    /// day_of_month                            |
    /// | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
    /// :-------------------------------------- |
    /// | yearly          | optional (required if `day_of_month` provided) |
    /// optional (required if `month` provided) |
    /// | monthly         | invalid                                        |

    ///
    /// When a charge date falls on a non-business day, one of two things will
    /// happen:
    ///
    /// - if the recurrence rule specified `-1` as the `day_of_month`, the
    /// charge date will be rolled __backwards__ to the previous business day
    /// (i.e., the last working day of the month).
    /// - otherwise the charge date will be rolled __forwards__ to the next
    /// business day.
