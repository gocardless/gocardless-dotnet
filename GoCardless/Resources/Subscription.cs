    /// 
    /// - The first payment must be charged within 1 year.
    /// - If `day_of_month` and `start_date` are not provided `start_date` will
    /// be the [mandate](#core-endpoints-mandates)'s `next_possible_charge_date`
    /// and the subscription will then recur based on the `interval` &
    /// `interval_unit`
    /// - If `month` or `day_of_month` are present the following validations
    /// apply:
    /// 
    /// | __interval_unit__ | __month__                                      |
